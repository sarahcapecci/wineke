            <h2>Energy Healing</h2>
            <p>Energy healing is a completely natural process that benefits your physical, mental, and emotional health. Energy healing works by aligning the chakras. Dating back to ancient Hindu metaphysical and yogic traditions, chakras are our energy centers. When these energy centers become blocked, unaligned, or imbalanced, our health and wellbeing may be compromised.</p>
            <p>I am able to restore the health of your chakras by acting as a channel for you to accept light energy from the universe. This light energy is positive, pure, and divine. As a result, your chakras will adapt a positive and open flow, preventing illness and pain. I am able to facilitate this transfer of energy because my consciousness has reached a vibrational realm beyond the third dimension. As metaphysical as energy healing is, itâ€™s actually a very simple process. Everyone can benefit from energy healing as everyone and everything is essentially energy.</p>
            <p>As a certified energy healer, I am trained and specialize in specific modalities. Each modality that I practice has a unique process and benefit. The most innovative modality to date is CCMBA (Complete Cellular Mind Body Alignment). The CCMBA process takes 90 minutes. During this time I act as a channel for light energy by tapping into higher frequencies while placing my hand on your forehead.</p>
            <p>Very much like yoga and meditation, energy healing is absolutely spiritual and enlightening. To allow yourself to heal and clear karmic debris is a most beautiful experience. This being said, it may take some time and patience to fully allow yourself to heal and tap into a higher vibrational realm.</p>
