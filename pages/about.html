    <h3>Tell us a bit about yourself.</h3>
    <p>My name is Wineke (Winnie) Engelage and I am originally from the Netherlands. I began to facilitate energy healing when I became a certified Reiki Master in 2007. Since then I’ve taken many different courses across the country. Today I reside in Markham Ontario and live with my husband Joe and my pup, Oliver Twist.</p>
    <h3>Can anyone become an energy healer?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Currently we are experiencing a global shift in consciousness. All of us have the ability to tap into different dimensions. We just have to be open to it.</p>
    <h3>A lot of people don’t know what energy healing is, or that it exists. When did you discover this type of healing?</h3>
    <p>When I was a young adult I became very ill. I was told I would never be able to work again. My intuition guided me to energy healing doctors and other dimensional facilitators.</p>
    <h3>Would you recommend energy healing over western medicine?</h3>
    <p>No. As amazing as energy healing is, it should not be replaced by modern medicine. It should go hand in hand with it.</p>
    <h3>What is your goal?</h3>
    <p>I used to be afraid people would judge me if I said certain things. My goal is to let go of this fear and be completely open and honest about healing. By doing this I hope to guide people through a shift in consciousness.</p>
