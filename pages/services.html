            <p>Most session begins with priority testing. Priority testing reveals the root of a health problem by testing the muscle response stimulus in the body. After completing a priority test I am able to decide which modality best suits your needs. If there is a specific modality you are interested in, please let me know when you are booking your appointment.  Healing services are offered in home, online, and group.</p>
            <h3>One on One: Private Sessions</h3>
            <p>For those who live in the GTA an in home session is ideal. I have built a sanctuary in my home, where all my clients reach a state of ease. All modalities can be performed in these private sessions in the comfort of my own home.</p>
            <h3>Online: Skype</h3>
            <p>Add me to Skype winekehealing, and be healed even from a distance. Keep in mind, distance healing has its limitations and is only possible for certain programs such as qi gong, counseling sessions and guided meditation. Message me for more details.</p>
