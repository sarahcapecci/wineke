            <h2>Modalities</h2>
            <p>In the simplest of terms, a modality is a method of therapy. There are over 100 different energy-healing modalities. I am certified to perform many different modalities, download the list as a PDF here.</p>
            <h3>These are my most commonly used modalities:</h3>
            <p>Complete Cellular Mind Body Alignment (CCMBA) &amp; Complete Cellular Soul Memory Clearing (CCSMC) Clearing on a DNA, cellular and morphogenetic level.
            The most innovative modality to date is CCMBA (Complete Cellular Mind Body Alignment). The CCMBA process takes 90 minutes. During this time I act as a channel for light energy by tapping into higher frequencies while placing my hand on your forehead. CCMBA targets the problem wherever it exists and works on all levels - mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual.</p>
            <h3>Benefits include:</h3>
            <ul class="benefits">
                <li>Release of deep-seated emotional and physical trauma</li>
                <li>Bone realignment</li>
                <li>Relief from chronic back/neck pain and/or scoliosis</li>
                <li>A new ability to let go of non-desirable habits</li>
                <li>Divine spiritual awakening</li>
                <li>More energy on a day to day basis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The possibilities are wide and far. This type of energy transfer has proven to provide unique individual results. Each time you experience the CCMBA and CCSMC you will work on something different; and you will experience something different - often on higher, deeper, and more profound levels.</p>
            <h3>Dimensional Shift Consciousness Facilitator</h3>
            <p>This modality is all about changing habits and thought patterns to raise your awareness (frequency) and speed up the healing process.</p>
            <h3>Black Pearl</h3>
            <p>The Black Pearl treatment directly affects the neurons of the amygdala. This region of the brain is responsible for your emotions and stress response connected to your memories. Acupressure and massage techniques are used to release negativity and improve flow. Benefits include increased brain activity, restoring blood flow, opening the third eye, calming stress and bouncing back from insomnia or fatigue.</p>
            <h3>Etheric Plane Communication</h3>
            <p>The Etheric Plane Communication therapy works to repair relationships. This therapy helps you make amends with people who are living and crossed over. Perhaps you ended a relationship in a hurtful, vindictive way; or someone passed over to the other side and you never had a chance to say goodbye. You can communicate with anyone of your choice, and they will feel it.</p>
            <h3>Reiki</h3>
            <p>A state of deep relaxation combined with a general feeling of well-being is the most noticeable and immediate effect of this modality. Reiki works to stimulate the bodies natural healing processes. Usually while practicing Reiki I will use various hand positions around the head, the front and back of the torso, the knees, and the feet. On average I will use between 12 and 20 positions with the whole treatment lasting anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes.</p>
            <p>One of the great things about Reiki is that I am also able to heal people in different geographical locations. It is not necessary that I use my hands. All I need is a photograph of whomever is receiving the healing. This is called Distance Healing. The results can be just as good as the results of sessions done in the physical :)</p>
